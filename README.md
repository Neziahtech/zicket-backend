Click fork
# 2. Clone it
git clone https://github.com/username/zicket-backend.git

## ⚙️ Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory using this command: `cp .env.example .env`

> Make sure you **never commit `.env`** to version control.

---

🚀 Running the App
Development mode (with hot reloading):
`npm run dev`
Production mode:
`npm run build`
`npm start`

---

🧪 Running Tests

# Run all tests

`npm run test`
Tests are written using Jest and live inside the src/tests directory.

## **Logging & Security**

- **Centralized sanitizer**: A structured logger is initialized at startup in `src/utils/logger.ts`. It overrides console methods to emit JSON logs with fields `{ timestamp, level, message, data }`.
- **What is masked**: Email addresses (e.g. `alice@example.com` → `a***e@example.com`) and 0x wallet addresses (e.g. `0x1234...abcd`) are automatically redacted in log messages and object payloads.
- **Queue job IDs**: Queue job IDs no longer embed raw emails — `src/services/queue.service.ts` uses a short SHA256-based hash for job identifiers.
- **Known remaining item**: The rate limiter currently uses `email` in its key generator (`src/middlewares/rateLimiter.ts`). Consider hashing or omitting emails there if you prefer zero-email storage in logs/keys.
- **Verification**: Run the test suite and a small demo to verify masking:

```bash
npm run build
npm test
npx ts-node src/scripts/log-demo.ts
```
